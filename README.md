# WealthWise Financial Website

A modern, responsive financial services website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrates with WordPress as a headless CMS.

## What This App Does

This app solves the challenge of creating a professional financial services website that combines the flexibility of custom development with the content management capabilities of WordPress. It addresses the common problem where financial advisors and firms need a high-performing, SEO-optimized website but also want non-technical team members to easily update content.

The solution provides a fast-loading, mobile-responsive website that can operate independently while seamlessly pulling dynamic content from WordPress when available. This hybrid approach ensures maximum uptime and performance - if WordPress goes down, the site continues to function with fallback content, maintaining professional credibility.

Key benefits:
- **Eliminates downtime concerns** - Site works even if WordPress is unavailable
- **Improves performance** - Static frontend loads faster than traditional WordPress themes
- **Maintains content flexibility** - Non-technical staff can update content via familiar WordPress interface
- **Reduces maintenance overhead** - Separates presentation from content management

This is a professional financial services website featuring:
- **Dynamic Hero Section** with compelling messaging and call-to-action
- **Services Showcase** displaying 6 key financial services with icons
- **About Section** with company information and professional imagery
- **Contact Form** with client-side validation and WordPress integration
- **Responsive Design** optimized for all devices
- **WordPress Integration** for dynamic content management
- **Fallback Content** ensures the site works even without WordPress

## Key Features

- **WordPress REST API Integration**: Dynamically fetches content from WordPress
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works offline with comprehensive default content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Modern Styling**: Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and Font Awesome icons
